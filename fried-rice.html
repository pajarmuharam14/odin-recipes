          <h2>Description about Fried Rice (Nasi Goreng)</h2>
          <p>While fried rice is famous all throughout Asia, it is one of the most popular comfort foods in Indonesia. <br>
            Indonesiaâ€™s take on fried rice often involves sweet soy sauce, scrambled eggs, shredded chicken, hot dog slices, as well as pickled cucumber and carrots (acar). If you are looking to try a different version of fried rice, there are many restaurants in Indonesia that offer nasi goreng gila (crazy fried rice), which is much hotter than regular fried rice.
