          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Upon setting your eyes on this soupy dish for the first time, the pitch-black broth might seem unusual and uninviting. However, donâ€™t let the aesthetic fool you. The black broth is a result of kluwak (Pangium) that is used as
            one of the main spices for this cow meat dish.
          </p>
          <p>The slow-cooking process allows the flavor to penetrate deep into the meat and tenderize it so good that it melts in your mouth.</p>
