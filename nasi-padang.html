          <h2>Description about nasi padang</h2>
          <p>Nasi padang’s flavorful sensation even reaches overseas to Singapore – to which point even Singaporean often say they can’t live without it.</p>
          <p>
            Nasi Padang is a flavour-rich dish originated from Padang, Indonesia. It is a rice-based meal topped with various dishes, including curries, chickens, fishes, and various parts of cow meats (sometimes even cow’s feet). The best
            way to eat nasi Padang is, according to 99% of Indonesian, by putting away your cutleries and digging in with your (clean) hands. Once you’re finished, wash down all the greasy goodness with a glass of refreshing iced tea.
